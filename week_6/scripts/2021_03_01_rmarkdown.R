### Notes #####
#only need two pieces of work: Title and output

#if you want to create the html file, it is calling knitting it

#Header decides 

# if you want a new line, need two spaces between sentences

#For images: ![](link or directory)

#Code chunks: keyboard shortcut is Ctl alt I

### Totally Awesome R package #####
