# Introduction
Today we will be learning how to look for and find help when we are struggling.

# Load Libraries 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Producing a script with errors
```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))%>%
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
```



```{r}
data<-tibble::tribble(
    ~lat,    ~long, ~star_no,
  33.548, -117.805,      10L,
  35.534, -121.083,       1L,
  39.503, -123.743,      25L,
  32.863,  -117.24,      22L,
   33.46, -117.671,       8L,
  33.548, -117.805,       3L
  )

# Awesome R package
